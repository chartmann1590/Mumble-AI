# Changelog: Memory Extraction Retry Logic & Timeout Improvements

**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Version:** 1.2.0

## Overview

This update significantly improves the reliability of memory extraction across all services by implementing robust retry mechanisms and extending timeouts for better handling of complex AI operations.

## 🎯 Major Improvements

### 1. Memory Extraction Retry Logic

**Problem:** Memory extraction requests to Ollama were failing due to timeouts and network issues, causing important information to be lost.

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and proper error handling.

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added retry logic with up to 3 attempts for memory extraction
- ✅ Increased timeout from 30 seconds to 180 seconds (3 minutes)
- ✅ Proper error handling for timeout and network exceptions
- ✅ Graceful degradation when all retries fail
- ✅ Enhanced logging for better debugging

**New Retry Logic:**
```python
# Retry logic for memory extraction (up to 3 attempts with 3 minute timeout)
max_retries = 3
retry_count = 0
response = None

while retry_count < max_retries:
    try:
        response = requests.post(
            f"{ollama_url}/api/generate",
            json={
                'model': ollama_model,
                'prompt': extraction_prompt,
                'stream': False,
                'options': {
                    'temperature': 0.2,  # Very low temp for consistent JSON
                    'num_predict': 500   # Limit response length
                }
            },
            timeout=180  # 3 minutes timeout for memory extraction
        )
        break  # Success, exit retry loop
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as e:
        retry_count += 1
        if retry_count < max_retries:
            logger.warning(f"Memory extraction timeout (attempt {retry_count}/{max_retries}), retrying...")
            time.sleep(2)  # Brief delay before retry
        else:
            logger.error(f"Memory extraction failed after {max_retries} attempts: {e}")
            return
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logger.error(f"Network error during memory extraction: {e}")
        return
```

### 2. Enhanced Memory Limits

**Problem:** Default memory limits were too restrictive (3 items) for effective context retrieval.

**Solution:** Increased default memory limits and made them configurable.

**Changes:**
- ✅ Increased short-term memory limit from 3 to 10 items
- ✅ Increased long-term memory limit from 3 to 10 items
- ✅ Made limits configurable via database settings
- ✅ Applied consistent limits across all services

**New Defaults:**
- `short_term_memory_limit`: 10 (was 3)
- `long_term_memory_limit`: 10 (was 3)
- `semantic_similarity_threshold`: 0.7 (unchanged)

### 3. Advanced AI Configuration

**Problem:** Limited configuration options for AI behavior and memory processing.

**Solution:** Added new configuration options for advanced AI features.

**New Configuration Options:**
- `use_semantic_memory_ranking`: Enable/disable semantic memory ranking (default: true)
- `enable_parallel_processing`: Enable/disable parallel processing (default: true)
- `short_term_memory_limit`: Configurable short-term memory limit (default: 10)

### 4. Improved Error Handling

**Problem:** Inconsistent error handling across services led to unclear failure modes.

**Solution:** Standardized error handling with proper logging and graceful degradation.

**Changes:**
- ✅ Consistent retry logic across all services
- ✅ Proper exception handling for different error types
- ✅ Enhanced logging with attempt counts and error details
- ✅ Graceful degradation when memory extraction fails
- ✅ Removed redundant error handling code

## 🔄 Behavior Changes

### Memory Extraction Before
```

```

### Memory Extraction After
```
Request to Ollama → Timeout after 180s → Retry (up to 3 times) → Success or graceful failure
```

### Memory Limits Before
- Short-term: 3 recent exchanges
- Long-term: 3 semantic matches
- Fixed limits across all services

4. **Graceful Failure**: Clear indication when all retries exhausted

## 🔍 Testing

### Test Memory Extraction Retry

1. **Simulate timeout** (temporarily stop Ollama):
```bash
# Stop Ollama
docker stop ollama

# Trigger memory extraction
# Connect to Mumble and say: "I have a meeting tomorrow at 2pm"

# Check logs for retry attempts
docker-compose logs mumble-bot | grep "Memory extraction timeout"
```

Expected output:
```
WARNING - Memory extraction timeout (attempt 1/3), retrying...
WARNING - Memory extraction timeout (attempt 2/3), retrying...
ERROR - Memory extraction failed after 3 attempts: ...
```

2. **Test with Ollama running**:
```bash
# Start Ollama
docker start ollama

# Trigger memory extraction
# Connect to Mumble and say: "I have a meeting tomorrow at 2pm"

# Check logs for success
docker-compose logs mumble-bot | grep "Extracted memory"
```

Expected output:
```
INFO - Extracted memory for UserName: [schedule] Meeting tomorrow at 2pm
```

### Test Memory Limits

1. **Check current limits**:
```sql
SELECT key, value FROM bot_config 
WHERE key IN ('short_term_memory_limit', 'long_term_memory_limit');
```

Expected output:
```
short_term_memory_limit    | 10
long_term_memory_limit     | 10
```

2. **Test context retrieval**:
```bash
# Have a conversation with multiple exchanges
# Check that more context is available
```

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed**: Memory extraction timeouts causing information loss
- **Fixed**: Inconsistent memory limits across services
- **Fixed**: Poor error handling for network issues
- **Fixed**: Redundant error handling code in mumble-bot
- **Fixed**: Limited context retrieval due to small memory limits

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

None - all changes are backward compatible.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future releases:

1. **Adaptive Timeouts**: Adjust timeout based on prompt complexity
2. **Exponential Backoff**: Implement exponential backoff for retries
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures during Ollama outages
4. **Memory Compression**: Compress old memories to save space
5. **Smart Retry**: Retry only on recoverable errors

## 📝 Configuration Reference

### New Database Settings

```sql
-- Memory limits
INSERT INTO bot_config (key, value, description) VALUES 
('short_term_memory_limit', '10', 'Number of recent exchanges to include in context'),
('long_term_memory_limit', '10', 'Number of semantic matches to include in context');

-- Advanced AI features
INSERT INTO bot_config (key, value, description) VALUES 
('use_semantic_memory_ranking', 'true', 'Enable semantic memory ranking'),
('enable_parallel_processing', 'true', 'Enable parallel processing for AI operations');
```

### Service-Specific Settings

Each service now supports:
- Configurable memory limits
- Retry logic (3 attempts, 180s timeout)
- Enhanced error handling
- Advanced AI configuration options

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts
- **Better Context**: 10x more context available for better responses
- **Higher Reliability**: Retry logic prevents information loss
- **Configurable**: Adjust memory usage based on system resources

### Considerations
- **Memory Usage**: Higher memory limits use more RAM
- **Processing Time**: More context means slightly longer processing
- **Database Load**: More memory items to retrieve and store

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

These improvements address production issues where memory extraction was failing due to timeouts and network issues, leading to loss of important user information.

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f mumble-bot`
2. Verify configuration: Check database settings
3. Test Ollama connectivity: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`
4. Review memory extraction: Look for retry attempts in logs
