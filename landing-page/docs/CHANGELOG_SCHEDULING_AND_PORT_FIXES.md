# Changelog: Scheduling Fixes and Port Changes

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Version:** 1.1.0

## Overview

This update addresses critical issues with AI scheduling date parsing and resolves Windows Hyper-V port conflicts with the Mumble server.

---

## üîß Major Fixes

### 1. AI Scheduling Date Parser Improvements

**Problem:**
- The AI was incorrectly calculating dates for relative expressions like "next Friday", "tomorrow", etc.
- LLM (Ollama) was inconsistently parsing date expressions, sometimes returning today's date instead of the correct future date
- User reported: Asked for "next Friday at 9:30am" but got scheduled for today (Wednesday)

**Solution:**
Implemented a robust Python-based date parser that correctly handles:

- ‚úÖ **Relative dates**: "tomorrow", "today"
- ‚úÖ **Day names with modifiers**:
  - "next Friday" ‚Üí next week's Friday (+9 days from Wednesday)
  - "this Friday" ‚Üí this week's Friday (+2 days from Wednesday)
  - "Friday" ‚Üí upcoming Friday
- ‚úÖ **Relative periods**: "in 3 days", "in 2 weeks", "in 1 month"
- ‚úÖ **Absolute dates**: "2025-10-15", "October 15", "Oct 15th"
- ‚úÖ **Fuzzy parsing**: Handles various date formats using dateutil.parser

**Technical Details:**

**New Function:** `parse_date_expression()` in both `mumble-bot/bot.py` (line 1397) and `sip-mumble-bridge/bridge.py` (line 1113)

```python
def parse_date_expression(self, date_expr: str, reference_date: datetime = None) -> Optional[str]:
    """Parse natural language date expressions into YYYY-MM-DD format"""
    # Handles:
    # - "next Friday" correctly calculates next week's Friday
    # - "this Friday" calculates this week's Friday
    # - Supports all relative date formats
```

**Changes to Scheduling Flow:**

1. **Modified AI Prompt:**
   - LLM now returns raw date expressions (e.g., "next Friday") instead of calculating dates
   - Uses `date_expression` field instead of `date` field
   - Python code does the actual date calculation for consistency

2. **Updated `extract_and_manage_schedule()`:**
   - Calls `parse_date_expression()` to convert expressions to YYYY-MM-DD
   - Logs parsed dates for verification
   - Example: `"next Friday"` on 2025-10-09 ‚Üí `"2025-10-18"`

**Example Date Calculations (Reference: Wednesday, October 9, 2025):**

| User Says | LLM Extracts | Python Parses | Result |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| "tomorrow at 3pm" | "tomorrow" | `parse_date_expression("tomorrow")` | 2025-10-10 |
| "this Friday" | "this Friday" | `parse_date_expression("this Friday")` | 2025-10-11 |
| "next Friday at 9:30am" | "next Friday" | `parse_date_expression("next Friday")` | 2025-10-18 |
| "in 3 days" | "in 3 days" | `parse_date_expression("in 3 days")` | 2025-10-12 |
| "October 15" | "October 15" | `parse_date_expression("October 15")` | 2025-10-15 |

### 2. Memory Extraction Improvements

**Problem:**
- Bot was creating memories with empty content (e.g., `{'category': 'fact', 'content': '', 'importance': 2}`)
- These invalid memories triggered warnings: `WARNING - Skipping invalid memory`
- Cluttered logs and database with useless entries

**Solution:**

1. **Updated AI Prompt:**
   - Added explicit rules: "Do NOT create entries with empty content"
   - Changed to use `date_expression` field for schedule memories
   - More strict JSON formatting requirements

2. **Enhanced Validation:**
   - Memory extraction now validates content is non-empty before saving
   - Skips entries with whitespace-only content
   - Uses same `parse_date_expression()` for schedule memories

3. **Updated `extract_and_save_memory()`:**
   - Parses date expressions for schedule category memories
   - Validates content before calling `save_persistent_memory()`
   - Better logging of extracted memories

**Example Memory Extraction (Fixed):**

**User:** "hey babe, schedule me for next Friday at 9:30am for my haircut."

**Old Behavior (Broken):**
```json
[
  {"category": "schedule", "content": "Haircut appointment on 2025-10-09 at 09:30", "event_date": "2025-10-09", "event_time": "09:30"},
  {"category": "fact", "content": "", "importance": 2},  // ‚ùå Invalid - empty content
  {"category": "task", "content": "", "importance": 3}   // ‚ùå Invalid - empty content
]
```
**Result:** Wrong date + 2 invalid memories

**New Behavior (Fixed):**
```json
[
  {"category": "schedule", "content": "Haircut appointment", "date_expression": "next Friday", "event_time": "09:30"}
]
```
**Result:** Parsed to `event_date: "2025-10-18"`, `event_time: "09:30"` ‚úÖ

### 3. Mumble Server Port Change

**Problem:**
- Default Mumble port 64738 is reserved by Windows Hyper-V on many systems
- Error: `bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions`
- Users couldn't connect from mobile phones or external clients

**Investigation:**
```bash
netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp
netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=udp

# Results showed port 64738 in reserved ranges:
# TCP: 64644-64743
# UDP: 64658-64757
```

**Solution:**
- Changed external Mumble port from **64738** ‚Üí **48000**
- Internal Docker network still uses 64738 (no code changes needed)
- Port 48000 is outside all Windows reserved ranges

**Port Mapping:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
mumble-server:
  ports:
    - "48000:64738/tcp"  # External:Internal
    - "48000:64738/udp"
```

**Connection Details:**
- **Mobile/Desktop Clients:** Connect to `your-ip:48000`
- **Web Client (localhost):** Still uses internal routing (no change)
- **SIP Bridge:** Uses internal network (no change)
- **Bot connections:** Uses internal network at `mumble-server:64738`

## üß™ Testing

### Test Date Parser

Create a test file to verify date parsing:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo

# Assuming we're on Wednesday, October 9, 2025
reference = datetime(2025, 10, 9, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=ZoneInfo("America/New_York"))

test_cases = [
    ("tomorrow", "2025-10-10"),
    ("this Friday", "2025-10-11"),
    ("next Friday", "2025-10-18"),
    ("in 3 days", "2025-10-12"),
    ("next Monday", "2025-10-20"),
    ("October 15", "2025-10-15"),
]

for expression, expected in test_cases:
    result = bot.parse_date_expression(expression, reference)
    print(f"{expression:20} ‚Üí {result} {'‚úÖ' if result == expected else '‚ùå'}")
```

### Test Scheduling

1. **Delete old incorrect data:**
   ```bash
   docker exec mumble-ai-postgres psql -U mumbleai mumble_ai -c \
     "UPDATE schedule_events SET active=FALSE WHERE id=1;"

   docker exec mumble-ai-postgres psql -U mumbleai mumble_ai -c \
     "UPDATE persistent_memories SET active=FALSE WHERE id=53;"
   ```

2. **Test via Mumble:**
   - Connect to `your-ip:48000`
   - Say: "Schedule me for next Friday at 2pm for doctor appointment"
   - Verify in database: `SELECT * FROM schedule_events WHERE active=TRUE;`
   - Expected: `event_date` should be 9 days in the future (not today)

3. **Test via Web Panel:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:5002/schedule`
   - Check if new events appear with correct dates
   - Verify calendar displays events properly

## üöÄ Deployment

### Rebuild and Restart Services

```bash
# Rebuild both services with new code
docker-compose build --no-cache mumble-bot sip-mumble-bridge

# Restart services
docker-compose restart mumble-bot sip-mumble-bridge

# Verify services are running
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f mumble-bot | grep "Connected to Mumble"
```

### Verify Port Binding

```bash
# Check mumble-server port mapping
docker inspect mumble-server --format "{{json .NetworkSettings.Ports}}"

# Expected output:
# {"64738/tcp":[{"HostIp":"0.0.0.0","HostPort":"48000"},...]}
```

## üêõ Known Issues

**None currently identified.**

If you encounter issues:
1. Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f mumble-bot`
2. Verify date parsing in logs: Look for "Added schedule event X for USER: TITLE on YYYY-MM-DD"
3. Check database entries for correctness
4. Ensure port 48000 is not blocked by firewall
