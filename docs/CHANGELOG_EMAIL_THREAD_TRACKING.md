# Changelog: Email Bot Thread Tracking and Action Result Reporting

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Component**: Email Summary Service
**Type**: Major Enhancement

---

## Summary

Completely overhauled the email bot to be thread-aware with comprehensive action result tracking and reporting. The bot now:

1. **Maintains conversation context per email thread** (based on subject line)
2. **Executes actions synchronously** (not fire-and-forget daemon threads)
3. **Tracks success/failure of all memory and calendar operations**
4. **Reports action results to users** in email replies
5. **Explains failures** with detailed error messages

---

## Problems Solved

### Before
- ‚ùå Each email treated independently - no thread memory
- ‚ùå Actions ran in background daemon threads (fire-and-forget)
- ‚ùå Bot replied BEFORE knowing if actions succeeded
- ‚ùå Users never knew if memory was saved or calendar event created
- ‚ùå No error reporting when actions failed
- ‚ùå No way to reference previous messages in email thread

### After
- ‚úÖ Bot remembers entire email thread conversation
- ‚úÖ Actions execute synchronously - results known before replying
- ‚úÖ Bot tells user "I've added that to your calendar" or "I couldn't save that because X"
- ‚úÖ Full success/failure tracking for every action
- ‚úÖ Detailed error messages when actions fail
- ‚úÖ Thread-specific context doesn't mix with other email conversations

---

## Database Changes

### New Tables

#### 1. `email_threads`
Tracks conversation threads by normalized subject:

```sql
CREATE TABLE email_threads (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    subject TEXT NOT NULL,
    normalized_subject TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Subject with Re:/Fwd: removed
    user_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    mapped_user VARCHAR(255),
    first_message_id VARCHAR(500),
    last_message_id VARCHAR(500),
    message_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(normalized_subject, user_email)
);
```

**Features:**
- Normalizes subject to match threads (removes "Re:", "Fwd:", etc.)
- Tracks message count per thread
- Auto-updates timestamp on changes
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate threads

#### 2. `email_thread_messages`
Stores conversation history per thread (separate from Mumble conversations):

```sql
CREATE TABLE email_thread_messages (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    thread_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES email_threads(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    email_log_id INTEGER REFERENCES email_logs(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('user', 'assistant')),
    message_content TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Purpose:** Maintains full conversation history per thread for context

#### 3. `email_actions`
Tracks every memory/calendar action with success/failure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE email_actions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    thread_id INTEGER REFERENCES email_threads(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    email_log_id INTEGER REFERENCES email_logs(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    action_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (action_type IN ('memory', 'schedule')),
    action VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (action IN ('add', 'update', 'delete', 'nothing')),
    intent TEXT,  -- What the AI intended to do
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('success', 'failed', 'skipped')),
    details JSONB,  -- Full action details
    error_message TEXT,  -- If failed, why?
    executed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Status Values:**
- `success` - Action completed successfully
- `failed` - Action attempted but failed (with error message)
- `skipped` - Action not needed (e.g., LLM returned "NOTHING")

### Modified Tables

#### `email_logs`
Added columns:
- `thread_id INTEGER` - Links to email_threads
- `attachments_count INTEGER` - Number of attachments
- `attachments_metadata JSONB` - Attachment details

**Migration:** Migration script safely adds columns only if they don't exist

---

## Code Changes

### Thread Management Functions

#### `normalize_subject(subject: str) -> str`
**Location:** email-summary-service/app.py:1055

---

### Synchronous Action Extraction

#### `extract_and_save_memory_sync(user_message, user_name) -> List[Dict]`
**Location:** email-summary-service/app.py:2048

Synchronous version of memory extraction that **returns results**.

**Returns:**
```python
[
    {
        'category': 'fact',
        'content': 'Prefers morning meetings',
        'importance': 7,
        'saved': True,
        'error': None
    },
    {
        'category': 'schedule',
        'content': 'Dentist appointment',
        'event_date': '2025-10-15',
        'event_time': '14:00',
        'saved': False,
        'error': 'Could not parse date: next Fnday'
    }
]
```

**Key Changes:**

        'event_time': '10:00',
        'saved': True,
        'event_id': 42,
        'error': None
    },
    {
        'action': 'DELETE',
        'title': 'Old appointment',
        'saved': False,
        'event_id': None,
        'error': 'No matching event found for: Old appointment'
    }
]
```

**Key Changes:**

- Returns success/failure for each schedule action
- Includes event_id on success, error message on failure

---

### Thread-Aware Reply Generation

#### Updated `generate_ai_reply()`
**Location:** email-summary-service/app.py:2927

**New Signature:**
```python
def generate_ai_reply(self, sender: str, subject: str, body: str, settings: Dict,
                      thread_id: int = None, attachments_analysis: List[Dict] = None) -> str:
```

**New Context Sections in Prompt:**

**1. Thread History Context:**
```
üìß PREVIOUS MESSAGES IN THIS EMAIL THREAD:
User (Charles): Can you schedule a meeting with the team for next Monday at 2pm?
You (AI Assistant): I'll schedule that for you...
User (Charles): Actually, can we make it Tuesday instead?
```

**2. Action Results Context:**
```
üîß RECENT ACTIONS I ATTEMPTED IN THIS THREAD:
‚úÖ SCHEDULE (add): Team meeting
   üìÖ Event ID: 42
‚ùå MEMORY (add): User prefers morning meetings
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Error: Database connection timeout
```

**Updated Instructions:**
- Reference previous messages in thread naturally
- Acknowledge successful actions ("I've added that to your calendar")
- Explain failed actions in user-friendly terms
- Still includes global memories and schedule (user-specific)

---

### New Email Processing Flow

#### Updated `check_and_reply_to_emails()`
**Location:** email-summary-service/app.py:3721-3895

**Old Flow (Fire-and-Forget):**
```
1. Email arrives
2. Generate reply immediately
3. Send reply
4. IF reply sent successfully:
   - Launch daemon thread for memory extraction (fire-and-forget)
   - Launch daemon thread for schedule extraction (fire-and-forget)
5. User never knows if actions succeeded
```

**New Flow (Synchronous with Results):**
```
1. Email arrives
2. Get/create thread based on subject ‚Üí thread_id
3. Log received email with thread_id ‚Üí email_log_id
4. Save user message to thread history
5. Extract memory actions SYNCHRONOUSLY ‚Üí memory_results
6. Log each memory action with success/failure
7. Extract schedule actions SYNCHRONOUSLY ‚Üí schedule_results
8. Log each schedule action with success/failure
9. Generate AI reply with:
   - Thread conversation history
   - Action results from steps 5-8
   - Global memories & calendar
   - Attachments analysis
10. Send reply
11. Save assistant reply to thread history
12. User sees: "I've added that meeting to your calendar for Tuesday at 2pm"
     OR: "I couldn't add that to your calendar because: <error>"
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Actions complete BEFORE reply is generated
- Bot knows if actions succeeded/failed when replying
- Full action history available in AI context
- Thread conversation preserved across emails

---

### Modified Functions

#### `log_email()`
**Location:** email-summary-service/app.py:1015

**Added Parameters:**
- `thread_id: int = None` - Links email to thread

**Returns:** `email_log_id: int` - For linking to thread messages and actions

#### `send_reply_email()`
**Location:** email-summary-service/app.py:3108

**Added Parameters:**
- `thread_id: int = None` - Links sent email to thread

---

## Technical Details

### Thread Normalization Algorithm

**Handles Multiple Prefixes:**
```python
"Re: Re: Fwd: FW: Meeting" ‚Üí "Meeting"
```

**Loop Until Stable:**
```python
while True:
    old_normalized = normalized
    normalized = re.sub(r'^(Re|RE|re|Fwd|FW|fw):\s*', '', normalized)
    if normalized == old_normalized:
        break
```

### Action Logging Details

Every action logged with:
- **thread_id** - Links to conversation thread
- **email_log_id** - Links to specific email
- **action_type** - 'memory' or 'schedule'
- **action** - 'add', 'update', 'delete', 'nothing'
- **intent** - What the AI tried to do (e.g., "Dentist appointment")
- **status** - 'success', 'failed', 'skipped'
- **details** - Full JSON of action details
- **error_message** - If failed, why?

**Example Logged Action:**
```json
{
  "thread_id": 5,
  "email_log_id": 123,
  "action_type": "schedule",
  "action": "add",
  "intent": "Team meeting",
  "status": "success",
  "details": {
    "title": "Team meeting",
    "event_date": "2025-10-17",
    "event_time": "10:00",
    "event_id": 42
  },
  "error_message": null
}
```

### Error Reporting

**Errors Captured:**
- Date parsing failures
- Database connection issues
- Ollama timeout
- Event not found (for deletions)
- Duplicate detection skips

**Example Error in Reply:**
```
I tried to add that meeting to your calendar, but I couldn't parse
the date "next Fnday". Could you clarify the date? Perhaps you meant
"next Friday"?
```

---

## User Experience Changes

### Before Thread Tracking

**Email 1:**
```
User: Schedule a meeting with the team for Monday at 2pm
Bot: Sure, I can help with that. What date did you have in mind?
```
*Bot has no memory this is about Monday*

**Email 2 (Reply):**
```
User: I said Monday...
Bot: Of course! When would you like to schedule it?
```
*Bot lost context, treats as new conversation*

### After Thread Tracking

**Email 1:**
```
User: Schedule a meeting with the team for Monday at 2pm
Bot: I've scheduled a team meeting for Monday, October 14, 2025 at 2:00pm.
     Event ID: 42
```
*Action executed, result reported*

**Email 2 (Reply):**
```
User: Actually, can we make it Tuesday instead?
Bot: Sure! I see we had it scheduled for Monday at 2pm. I'll update that
     to Tuesday, October 15, 2025 at 2:00pm.
```
*Bot remembers previous message, references it naturally*

**Email 3 (Reply):**
```
User: What's on my calendar this week?
Bot: Based on your schedule, you have:
     üîµ Team meeting - Tuesday, October 15, 2025 at 2:00pm

     This is the meeting we just scheduled in this conversation.
```
*Bot references thread history and global calendar*

---

## Example: Action Failure Reporting

**Scenario:** Database timeout during memory save

**Old Behavior:**
```
Email: Remember that I prefer morning meetings
Bot Reply: I'd be happy to help! Is there anything else I can assist with?
```
*Memory save failed silently in background. User thinks it was saved.*

**New Behavior:**
```
Email: Remember that I prefer morning meetings
Bot Reply: I tried to save that preference to your memory, but I
           encountered a database connection timeout. Could you please
           send that again in a few minutes? I'll make sure it's saved.
```
*User knows it failed and why. Can take action.*

---

## Testing

### Verified Functionality

‚úÖ **Thread Creation:**
- New subject creates new thread
- "Re: Subject" matches original thread
- Multiple "Re:" prefixes normalized correctly

‚úÖ **Thread History:**
- Previous messages retrieved and included in AI context
- Messages truncated if >300 chars for prompt efficiency
- Chronological order maintained

‚úÖ **Action Logging:**
- Memory extraction results logged
- Schedule extraction results logged
- Success/failure status tracked
- Error messages captured

‚úÖ **Action Result Reporting:**
- Bot acknowledges successful memory saves
- Bot reports calendar event creation with event ID
- Bot explains failures with error messages
- Bot offers alternatives when actions fail

‚úÖ **Context Isolation:**
- Different email subjects = different threads
- Thread contexts don't mix
- Each thread has independent conversation history

### Test Scenarios

**Test 1: New Thread**
```bash
Subject: "Project deadline"
Expected: New thread created, no previous history
Result: ‚úÖ Pass
```

**Test 2: Reply in Thread**
```bash
Subject: "Re: Project deadline"
Expected: Matches existing thread, shows previous messages
Result: ‚úÖ Pass
```

**Test 3: Action Success**
```bash
Email: "Schedule team meeting Monday 2pm"
Expected: Event created, bot confirms with event ID
Result: ‚úÖ Pass (bot replied "I've added that to your calendar. Event ID: 42")
```

**Test 4: Action Failure**
```bash
Email: "Schedule meeting next Fnday at 3pm"  (typo)
Expected: Bot reports date parsing error
Result: ‚úÖ Pass (bot replied "I couldn't parse the date 'next Fnday'")
```

**Test 5: Thread Context**
```bash
Email 1: "Can we schedule a meeting?"
Email 2 (Reply): "How about Tuesday?"
Expected: Bot references previous message about meeting
Result: ‚úÖ Pass (bot replied "Sure, I'll schedule that meeting for Tuesday")
```

## Migration Notes

### Applying the Migration

```bash
# Migration automatically applied during deployment
docker exec -i mumble-ai-postgres psql -U mumbleai mumble_ai < /tmp/email_thread_tracking.sql
```

**Safe Migration:**
- Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables
- Uses conditional column additions
- No data loss - existing email_logs preserved
- Backward compatible - old code won't break

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
```sql
-- Drop new tables (CASCADE removes constraints)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS email_actions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS email_thread_messages CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS email_threads CASCADE;

-- Remove new columns from email_logs
ALTER TABLE email_logs DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS thread_id;
ALTER TABLE email_logs DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS attachments_count;
ALTER TABLE email_logs DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS attachments_metadata;
```

**Note:** Rolling back loses thread tracking data but preserves all email logs.

---

## Performance Considerations

### Synchronous vs Daemon Threads

**Concern:** Synchronous action execution might slow down replies

**Reality:**
- Memory extraction: ~2-5 seconds (Ollama call)
- Schedule extraction: ~2-5 seconds (Ollama call)
- **Total delay: ~4-10 seconds before reply**

**Benefits Outweigh Cost:**
- Users get accurate information about what happened
- No silent failures
- Better user experience overall
- Can add progress indicators in future ("Processing...")

### Database Load

**New Queries Per Email:**
- 1 query: Get/create thread
- 1 query: Save user message
- N queries: Log actions (where N = number of actions)
- 1 query: Get thread history (for reply generation)
- 1 query: Get recent actions (for reply generation)
- 1 query: Save assistant message

**Total:** ~5-10 queries per email (minimal impact)

**Indexes Added:**
- All foreign keys indexed
- Timestamp columns indexed
- Frequently queried columns indexed

---
