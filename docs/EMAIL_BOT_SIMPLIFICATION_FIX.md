# Email Bot Simplification Fix

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Issue**: Bot was too verbose, confused about ownership, listing irrelevant events, and getting confused
**Status**: FIXED

---

## The Problems

### Example of What Was Happening

**User sent:** "Here's my flight confirmation" (PDF attached)

**Bot replied:**
```
Dear Charles,

Thank you for reaching out and adding your return flight back on October 25th
to my calendar. I've taken a look at the attached letter and made sure
everything looks correct.

I understand that there was an error message when I tried to add your travel
dates to the schedule, but I'm happy to help you with this! Could you please
clarify what specific dates and times you'd like me to add to your calendar
for the Orlando trip? I've taken note of all the upcoming events in your
schedule, including Mel and Ryan's baby shower on October 11th, Travel Dates
review on October 15th, and your haircut appointment on October 17th.

To confirm, the flights from Albany to Orlando and back again are booked for
October 21st and 25th, respectively. I've updated your calendar accordingly.

Best,
Emily (Live-in Maid)

"Spreading joy one tidy room at a time."

Warmly and with a smile,
Emily (Live-in Maid)
"Spreading joy one tidy room at a time."
```

### Specific Issues Identified

1. **Ownership Confusion (CRITICAL)**
   - ‚ùå "Thank you for adding to MY calendar"
   - ‚úÖ Should be: "I've added to YOUR calendar"
   - Bot confused who did what

2. **Too Verbose**
   - Formal greeting "Dear Charles,"
   - Multiple signatures
   - Taglines and flowery language
   - Way over 100 words

3. **Listing Irrelevant Events**
   - User asked about travel
   - Bot mentioned baby showers, haircuts, etc.
   - Should only mention what's relevant

4. **Contradictory Statements**
   - Says there was an error
   - Then says "I've updated your calendar accordingly"
   - Can't be both!

5. **Asking for Information Already Provided**
   - User sent PDF with dates
   - Bot asks "what dates would you like me to add?"
   - Should just acknowledge what it did

6. **Too Much Context**
   - Bot had access to: thread history, all memories, all calendar events, attachments
   - Tried to use ALL of it in every reply
   - Overwhelming and confusing

---

## The Root Cause

### Old Prompt Structure

```python
reply_prompt = f"""You are {bot_persona}.

You are an AI assistant responding to an email from {mapped_user if mapped_user else sender}.
{thread_context}              # All previous messages
{actions_context}              # All actions taken
{memory_context}               # ALL memories
{schedule_context}             # ALL upcoming events
{attachments_context}          # Attachment analysis

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- If there were recent actions, acknowledge them naturally
- Reference relevant memories or schedule events
- Be professional but conversational and friendly
- [... 20 more instructions ...]

Your reply:"""
```

**Problems:**
- Bot received EVERYTHING (100+ lines of context)
- Tried to reference all of it
- Got confused about what was relevant
- Instructions too vague ("acknowledge naturally")

---

## The Solution

### New Simplified Prompt

```python
# Determine what to include based on email content
include_schedule = any(keyword in body.lower() for keyword in
    ['schedule', 'calendar', 'appointment', 'meeting', 'event', 'when'])

reply_prompt = f"""You are {bot_persona}.

EMAIL FROM: {mapped_user if mapped_user else sender}
SUBJECT: {subject}
MESSAGE: {body}
{attachments_context}
---
{actions_context}              # Still show what actions were taken

üö® CRITICAL RULES:

1. BE BRIEF AND DIRECT
   - Keep replies under 100 words
   - No formal greetings like "Dear Charles"
   - No flowery language or unnecessary explanations
   - Get straight to the point

2. REPORT ONLY WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED
   - Look at the ACTION SUMMARY above
   - If ‚úÖ 1 calendar events: "Added [event] to your calendar for [date]"
   - If ‚úÖ 0 calendar events: Don't say you added anything
   - DON'T say "thank you for adding to my calendar" -
     YOU add to THEIR calendar, not the other way around

3. OWNERSHIP - THIS IS CRITICAL
   - The user ASKED you to add events
   - YOU (the AI) added events to THEIR calendar
   - CORRECT: "I've added the flight to your calendar"
   - WRONG: "Thank you for adding to my calendar"
   - NEVER confuse who did what

4. DON'T LIST UNRELATED EVENTS
   - If they ask about travel, ONLY mention travel
   - Don't list baby showers, haircuts, etc. unless they ask
     "what's on my calendar"
   - Stay focused on what they actually asked about

5. ANSWER THEIR QUESTION
   - If they sent a PDF: acknowledge it briefly
   - If they asked to add something: confirm what you added
   - If they asked a question: answer it directly
   - Don't add extra information they didn't ask for

{schedule_context if include_schedule else ""}  # ONLY if user asks

Your reply (brief and direct):"""
```

### Key Changes

1. **Removed Memories Section**
   - Not included in prompt anymore
   - Bot doesn't try to reference random facts
   - Stays focused on the current email

2. **Conditional Schedule**
   - Only includes schedule if user asks about calendar/events
   - If user sends a PDF about travel, doesn't list all events
   - Reduces information overload

3. **Removed Thread History**
   - Caused confusion about what happened when
   - Bot doesn't need to reference previous messages
   - Keeps replies focused on NOW

4. **Clear Ownership Rules**
   - Explicit instructions: "YOU add to THEIR calendar"
   - Examples of correct vs wrong phrasing
   - Can't be misunderstood

5. **Word Limit**
   - Explicit: "under 100 words"
   - Forces brevity
   - No room for rambling

6. **No Formal Greetings**
   - Explicit: "No 'Dear Charles'"
   - Get straight to the point
   - More like text message than formal letter

**Old Bot:**
```
Dear Charles,

Thank you for reaching out! I encountered an issue when trying to add
your meeting to the calendar. There seems to be... [200 words]
```

**New Bot:**
```
I couldn't add the meeting because I couldn't parse the date "next Fnday".
Did you mean "next Friday"? If so, I can add it for October 18 at 3:00pm.
```

## Testing

### Verification Steps
