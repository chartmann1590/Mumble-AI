# Memory and Task Creation System

## Overview

The Mumble AI bot implements an intelligent memory and task creation system that automatically extracts, categorizes, and stores important information from conversations. The system uses AI-powered analysis to identify schedules, facts, preferences, tasks, and other critical information, then makes this information available for future conversations.

## Memory Extraction Process

### Automatic Memory Extraction

After every conversation exchange, the bot automatically analyzes the dialogue and extracts important information:

1. **User says something** ‚Üí Bot responds
2. **Bot analyzes the exchange** using Ollama AI
3. **Extracts important information** into structured categories
4. **Assigns importance scores** (1-10) based on content analysis
5. **Saves to database** with metadata (user, session, timestamp)
6. **Makes memories available** for future conversations

### Extraction Algorithm

The memory extraction uses a specialized AI prompt to analyze conversations:

```python
extraction_prompt = f"""Analyze this conversation exchange and extract ANY important information that should be remembered.

User said: "{user_message}"
Assistant responded: "{assistant_response}"

Extract information in these categories:
- schedule: appointments, meetings, events with dates/times
- fact: personal information, preferences, relationships, important details
- task: things to do, reminders, action items
- preference: likes, dislikes, habits
- other: anything else important

Return ONLY a JSON array of memories (can be empty if nothing important).
Each memory should have:
{{"category": "schedule|fact|task|preference|other", "content": "brief description", "importance": 1-10}}

If there's nothing important to remember, return: []

JSON:"""
```

### Extraction Configuration

The extraction process uses specific settings for consistency:

```python
response = requests.post(
    f"{ollama_url}/api/generate",
    json={
        'model': ollama_model,
        'prompt': extraction_prompt,
        'stream': False,
        'options': {'temperature': 0.3}  # Lower temp for more consistent extraction
    },
    timeout=30
)
```

## Memory Categories

### 1. **üìÖ Schedule**
- **Purpose**: Time-based events and appointments
- **Examples**: "Doctor appointment Wednesday 2pm", "Meeting with John on Friday"
- **Usage**: Calendar queries and scheduling reminders
- **Importance**: Typically 7-9 for confirmed appointments

### 2. **üí° Fact**
- **Purpose**: Personal information and important details
- **Examples**: "Lives in New York City", "Works as a software engineer"

- **Purpose**: Likes, dislikes, and habits
- **Examples**: "Prefers tea over coffee", "Likes Italian food", "Hates mushrooms"
- **Usage**: Personalization and recommendation
- **Importance**: Typically 4-7 for preferences

### 5. **‚è∞ Reminder**
- **Purpose**: Time-based reminders and notifications
- **Examples**: "Take medication at 8am", "Call mom on Sunday"
- **Usage**: Automated reminders and notifications
- **Importance**: Typically 6-9 for important reminders

### 6. **üìå Other**
- **Purpose**: Miscellaneous important information
- **Examples**: "Allergic to peanuts", "Has a dog named Max"
- **Usage**: General context and safety information
- **Importance**: Varies based on content

## Importance Scoring System

### Scoring Criteria

The bot assigns importance scores (1-10) based on:

- **Urgency**: Time-sensitive information gets higher scores
- **Personal significance**: Important personal details score higher
- **Actionability**: Tasks and reminders get higher scores
- **Frequency**: Information mentioned multiple times scores higher
- **Context**: Information in important conversations scores higher

### Score Ranges

- **1-3 (Gray)**: Low importance - general preferences, minor facts
- **4-6 (Blue)**: Medium importance - regular tasks, common preferences
- **7-8 (Orange)**: High importance - important appointments, critical tasks
- **9-10 (Red)**: Critical importance - urgent tasks, safety information

### Scoring Examples

```json
[
  {
    "category": "schedule",
    "content": "Doctor appointment Wednesday 2pm",
    "importance": 8
  },
  {
    "category": "preference",
    "content": "Prefers tea over coffee",
    "importance": 5
  },
  {
    "category": "task",
    "content": "Call the dentist tomorrow",
    "importance": 7
  },
  {
    "category": "fact",
    "content": "Allergic to peanuts",
    "importance": 9
  }
]
```

## Memory Storage

### Database Schema

Memories are stored in the `persistent_memories` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE persistent_memories (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    extracted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    session_id VARCHAR(255),
    importance INTEGER DEFAULT 5,
    tags TEXT[],
    active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Storage Process

1. **Parse JSON response** from extraction
2. **Validate memory structure** (category, content, importance)
3. **Save to database** with user and session metadata
4. **Log extraction results** for monitoring
5. **Make available** for future conversations

```python
def save_persistent_memory(self, user_name: str, category: str, content: str, 
                          session_id: str = None, importance: int = 5, 
                          tags: List[str] = None):
    conn = self.get_db_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(
        """
        INSERT INTO persistent_memories
        (user_name, category, content, session_id, importance, tags)
        VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
        """,
        (user_name, category, content, session_id, importance, tags or [])
    )
    conn.commit()
```

## Memory Retrieval

### Retrieval Process

When generating responses, the bot retrieves relevant memories:

1. **Query database** for user's memories
2. **Sort by importance** and recency
3. **Limit results** to prevent prompt overflow (default: 10)
4. **Include in prompt** as "IMPORTANT SAVED INFORMATION"
5. **Use for factual responses** to user questions

### Retrieval Query

```python
def get_persistent_memories(self, user_name: str, limit: int = 10):
    conn = self.get_db_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(
        """
        SELECT category, content, importance, extracted_at
        FROM persistent_memories
        WHERE user_name = %s AND active = TRUE
        ORDER BY importance DESC, extracted_at DESC
        LIMIT %s
        """,
        (user_name, limit)
    )
    return cursor.fetchall()
```

### Memory Usage in Prompts

Retrieved memories are integrated into the bot's prompt:

```
IMPORTANT SAVED INFORMATION (use this to answer questions accurately):
[SCHEDULE] Funeral at church on Monday at 9am
[FACT] Lives in New York City
[PREFERENCE] Prefers tea over coffee
[TASK] Call the dentist tomorrow
[REMINDER] Take medication at 8am

Use this information to answer questions. If asked about schedules, tasks, or facts, refer to the saved information above.
```

## Task Management

### Task Creation

Tasks are automatically created when the bot identifies actionable items:

- **Explicit tasks**: "I need to call the dentist"
- **Implicit tasks**: "I should finish that report"
- **Reminders**: "Don't forget to pick up groceries"
- **Deadlines**: "The project is due Friday"

### Task Categories

Tasks are categorized based on content analysis:

- **Urgent**: High-priority, time-sensitive tasks
- **Important**: Significant but not urgent tasks
- **Routine**: Regular, recurring tasks
- **Personal**: Personal life tasks
- **Work**: Professional tasks

### Task Integration

Tasks are integrated into the bot's memory system:

1. **Extracted as tasks** during conversation analysis
2. **Stored with importance scores** based on urgency
3. **Retrieved for task queries** and reminders
4. **Used for proactive assistance** and follow-up

## Memory Management
