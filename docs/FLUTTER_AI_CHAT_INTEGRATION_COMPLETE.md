- **Error Mapping**: Maps error codes to user-friendly messages
- **Timeout Handling**: Specific handling for 5-minute timeout scenarios
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing error formats

#### 5. Performance Optimizations
- **Extended Timeout**: 5-minute timeout for AI chat requests (vs 10 seconds for other APIs)
- **Context Processing**: Server-side context building for better performance
- **Session Persistence**: Reduces API calls by maintaining session state

## API Integration Details

### New Endpoint Usage
```dart
POST /api/chat
{
  "user_name": "Charles",
  "message": "What's on my schedule this weekend?",
  "session_id": "ae5310a7-a1a3-4871-b622-0bd38668cb16",
  "include_memories": true,
  "include_schedule": true
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "response": "AI response with context",
    "session_id": "ae5310a7-a1a3-4871-b622-0bd38668cb16",
    "context_used": {
      "memories_count": 5,
      "schedule_events_count": 3
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Handling
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "OLLAMA_ERROR",
    "message": "AI service is currently unavailable",
    "details": "Connection timeout to Ollama service"
  }
}
```

- `uuid: ^3.0.7` - For session ID generation

## Testing Results

### ✅ Verified Functionality
- [x] AI chat sends messages to new `/api/chat` endpoint
- [x] User name is loaded from storage and sent to API
- [x] AI responses include context from memories and schedules
- [x] Context toggles work (enable/disable memories/schedules)
- [x] Context metadata displayed (memories_count, schedule_events_count)
- [x] Session ID persists across app restarts
- [x] Session reset works correctly
- [x] Error handling works for all error codes
- [x] Existing data is preserved after update (server URL, selected user)
- [x] Server URL remains configurable (not hardcoded)
- [x] Memory CRUD operations still work
- [x] Schedule CRUD operations still work
- [x] User selection flow unchanged
