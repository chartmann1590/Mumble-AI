# Deployment Summary - October 9, 2025

## ✅ All Changes Successfully Deployed

### 🔧 Issues Fixed

1. **AI Scheduling Date Calculation**
   - **Problem**: "next Friday" was being calculated as today instead of next week's Friday
   - **Solution**: Implemented Python-based date parser with proper logic
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed

2. **Invalid Empty Memories**
   - **Problem**: Bot was creating memories with empty content
   - **Solution**: Enhanced validation and improved AI prompts
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed

3. **Mumble Server Port Conflict**
   - **Problem**: Port 64738 reserved by Windows Hyper-V, preventing mobile connections
   - **Solution**: Changed external port to 48000 (internal remains 64738)
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### Database Cleanup

# Deleted incorrect schedule event (ID 1)
UPDATE schedule_events SET active=FALSE WHERE id=1;

# Deleted incorrect memory (ID 53)
UPDATE persistent_memories SET active=FALSE WHERE id=53;
```

```bash
# Verified mumble-server is bound to port 48000
docker inspect mumble-server --format "{{json .NetworkSettings.Ports}}"
# Result: Port 48000 correctly bound ✅
```

### Mobile Connection Test
```

## 📊 Date Parser Examples

Reference date: **Wednesday, October 9, 2025**

| User Input | LLM Extracts | Python Calculates | Final Date |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| "tomorrow at 3pm" | "tomorrow" | `parse_date_expression()` | 2025-10-10 (Thu) |
| "this Friday" | "this Friday" | `parse_date_expression()` | 2025-10-11 (Fri) |
| "next Friday at 9:30am" | "next Friday" | `parse_date_expression()` | 2025-10-18 (Fri) ✅ |
| "next Monday" | "next Monday" | `parse_date_expression()` | 2025-10-20 (Mon) |
| "in 3 days" | "in 3 days" | `parse_date_expression()` | 2025-10-12 (Sat) |

**Key Improvement**: "next Friday" on Wednesday now correctly calculates to next week's Friday (9 days ahead), not this week's Friday (2 days ahead).

## 🚨 Breaking Changes

### Port Change
**Action Required**: Update Mumble client connections to use port **48000** instead of 64738.

- **Internal services**: No changes needed (still use 64738 internally)
- **External connections**: Must use 48000

### Why the Change?
Windows Hyper-V reserves port ranges that include 64738:
- TCP: 64644-64743
- UDP: 64658-64757

Port 48000 is outside all reserved ranges and tested to work.

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check service logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f mumble-bot
   docker-compose logs -f sip-mumble-bridge
   ```

2. **Verify date parsing**: Look for log entries like:
   ```
   Added schedule event X for USER: TITLE on 2025-10-18
   ```

3. **Check database**:
   ```bash
   docker exec mumble-ai-postgres psql -U mumbleai mumble_ai -c \
     "SELECT * FROM schedule_events WHERE active=TRUE ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"
   ```

4. **Test port binding**:
   ```bash
   docker inspect mumble-server --format "{{json .NetworkSettings.Ports}}"
   ```
