# Upstream Files

## LICENSE

The ISC license file applies to the unmodified portions of the upstream mumble-web codebase that this project is built upon. It does not apply to the modifications and enhancements made in the mumbling-mole fork.

## Why this directory exists

- **Legal compliance**: The ISC license requires that the copyright notice and permission notice be included in all copies
- **Clear separation**: Keeping upstream license separate from the fork's pending licensing decision
- **Transparency**: Makes it clear which license applies to which parts of the codebase
