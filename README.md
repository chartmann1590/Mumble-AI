```

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Ollama installed and running locally
- A Mumble client (download from https://www.mumble.info/)

## Setup

### 1. Configure Environment

Copy the example environment file and customize it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to configure:
- `MUMBLE_PASSWORD` - Password for Mumble server superuser
- `BOT_USERNAME` - Name of the AI bot
- `WHISPER_MODEL` - Whisper model size (tiny, base, small, medium, large)
- `OLLAMA_MODEL` - Your Ollama model name (e.g., llama2, mistral, etc.)

### 2. Ensure Ollama is Running

Make sure Ollama is installed and running on your local machine:

```bash
ollama serve
```

Pull a model if you haven't already:

```bash
ollama pull llama2
```

### 3. Start the Stack

Build and start all services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

On first run, this will:
- Download and set up the Mumble server
- Download Whisper models
- Download 31 Piper TTS voice models
- Initialize PostgreSQL database
- Build and start the bot

### 4. Access the Control Panel

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5002
```

From here you can:
- Change AI models
- Select TTS voices
- Configure bot persona
- View conversation history
- Monitor statistics

### 5. Access the System

#### Option A: Traditional Mumble Client
1. Open your Mumble client
2. Add a new server:
   - **Address:** `localhost` (or your host's IP for remote connections)
   - **Port:** `48000` (changed from default 64738 due to Windows port reservation conflicts)
   - **Username:** Your name
   - **Password:** Leave empty (unless you set one)
3. Connect to the server
4. You should see the AI bot in the channel

> **Note:** The default Mumble port 64738 conflicts with Windows Hyper-V reserved port ranges. The external port has been changed to 48000, but the internal Docker network still uses 64738.

#### Option B: Web Client
1. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   https://localhost:8081
   ```
2. Accept the self-signed certificate warning (click "Advanced" → "Proceed")
3. Enter your username
4. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
5. Connect to the server
6. The AI bot will be available in the channel

> **Note:** The web client uses HTTPS with a self-signed certificate for microphone access. Your browser will show a security warning - this is normal for local development. For production, replace with a proper SSL certificate.

#### Option C: SIP Phone (Advanced)
1. Configure your SIP client or phone system
2. Point to `localhost:5060`
3. Use credentials from `.env` file:
   - **Username:** `mumble-bridge` (or your `SIP_USERNAME`)
   - **Password:** `bridge123` (or your `SIP_PASSWORD`)
4. Make a call - you'll hear a personalized welcome message and be connected to the AI assistant

## Services

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Mumble Server** | 48000 (external), 64738 (internal) | VoIP server with persistent data |
| **Faster Whisper** | 5000 | Speech-to-text API with GPU acceleration |
| **Piper TTS** | 5001 | Text-to-speech API (50+ voices, 9 languages) |
| **Web Control Panel** | 5002 | Management interface with real-time dashboard |
| **TTS Voice Generator** | 5003 | Standalone voice generation and cloning interface |
| **Silero TTS** | 5004 | Alternative text-to-speech API (20+ voices) |
| **Chatterbox TTS** | 5005 | Voice cloning TTS API with XTTS-v2 |
| **Email Summary Service** | 5006 | Email processing, summaries, and IMAP/SMTP |
| **PostgreSQL** | 5432 | Database (internal) with persistent storage |
| **AI Bot** | - | Mumble client with memory and scheduling |
| **SIP Bridge** | 5060 | SIP/RTP to Mumble bridge with welcome messages |
| **Mumble Web** | 8081 (HTTPS) | Web-based Mumble client with SSL |
| **Mumble Web Nginx** | - | SSL/TLS proxy for Mumble Web (internal) |
| **Mumble Web Simple** | - | Simplified web client (build only) |

**Port 48000 Explanation:** The standard Mumble port 64738 is reserved by Windows Hyper-V on many systems. Port 48000 is used externally to avoid conflicts, while internal Docker services still communicate on 64738.

**Mumble Web SSL:** The web client uses HTTPS on port 8081 with a self-signed certificate. This enables microphone access in modern browsers. For production use, replace with a CA-signed certificate.

## Usage

### Persistent Memories System

The bot automatically extracts and remembers important information from conversations:

**Categories:**
- 📅 **Schedule**: Appointments, meetings, events with dates/times
- 💡 **Fact**: Personal information, preferences, relationships
- ✓ **Task**: Things to do, reminders, action items
- ❤️ **Preference**: Likes, dislikes, habits
- ⏰ **Reminder**: Time-based reminders
- 📌 **Other**: Miscellaneous important info

**How it works:**
1. You tell the bot something important: "I have a meeting Monday at 2pm"
2. Bot automatically extracts and saves: [SCHEDULE] Meeting Monday at 2pm
3. Later you ask: "What's my schedule Monday?"
4. Bot retrieves the memory and responds accurately: "You have a meeting at 2pm"

**Managing Memories:**
- View all memories at `http://localhost:5002` under "🧠 Persistent Memories"
- Filter by user or category
- Add memories manually with the "+ Add Memory" button
- Delete outdated or incorrect memories
- Memories are shared across Mumble and SIP bridge

For detailed information, see [PERSISTENT_MEMORIES_GUIDE.md](./PERSISTENT_MEMORIES_GUIDE.md)

### Email Bot & Summaries

**AI Email Assistant** - Intelligent email processing with thread-aware conversations:

**Two-Way Email Communication:**
1. Configure IMAP settings in the web control panel to receive emails
2. Send emails to the bot's email address with requests or questions
3. Bot automatically processes attachments (PDFs, images, documents)
4. Receives intelligent, context-aware replies within minutes

**Thread-Aware Intelligence:**
- **Conversation Memory** - Bot remembers entire email threads by subject line
- **Action Tracking** - Every calendar/memory action logged with success/failure status
- **Truthful Reporting** - Bot only claims what it actually did, with Event IDs and timestamps
- **Error Explanations** - If actions fail, bot explains why and asks for clarification
- **Brief & Direct** - Replies kept under 100 words, no formal greetings or fluff
- **Focused Context** - Only mentions relevant information (no listing unrelated events)

**What the Bot Can Do Via Email:**
- **Add Calendar Events** - "Add team meeting Monday at 2pm" → Creates event, reports Event ID
- **Save Information** - "Remember I prefer morning meetings" → Saves to persistent memory
- **Answer Questions** - "What's on my calendar this week?" → Lists relevant events
- **Process Attachments** - Analyzes PDFs, images, and documents with AI vision
- **Natural Language** - Understands "tomorrow", "next Friday", "in 3 days", etc.

**Daily Email Summaries:**
1. Go to `http://localhost:5002` and scroll to "📧 Email Summary Settings"
2. Configure your SMTP settings (host, port, credentials)
3. Set recipient email and preferred delivery time
4. Click "Send Test Email" to verify configuration
5. Enable "Daily Summaries" to activate automatic sending

The bot will send beautifully formatted HTML emails with:
- **Upcoming Events** - Next 7 days with color-coded importance badges
- **Schedule Changes** - New events added in last 24 hours
- **New Memories** - Recently extracted facts, tasks, and preferences with category icons
- **AI-Generated Summary** - Intelligent conversation highlights using Ollama
- **Professional Design** - Responsive HTML with gradient headers and card layouts
- **Scheduled Delivery** - Automatic sending at your chosen time (default: 10pm EST)

For detailed information, see [EMAIL_SUMMARIES_GUIDE.md](./docs/EMAIL_SUMMARIES_GUIDE.md)

#### Email Retry Feature

If Ollama times out while generating email summaries or replies, the system will automatically retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff. If all attempts fail:

1. The failure is logged in the "📬 Email Activity Logs" section
2. An error message is displayed with details
3. Click the **🔄 Retry Sending** button to manually retry
4. The system will regenerate the content and attempt to send again

**Retry Behavior:**
- **Automatic**: 3 attempts with 2s, 4s, 8s delays between retries
- **Manual**: Click retry button in web control panel for failed emails
- **Smart Detection**: Distinguishes between Ollama failures (regenerate content) and SMTP failures (resend existing)

For detailed information, see [EMAIL_RETRY_FEATURE.md](docs/EMAIL_RETRY_FEATURE.md)

### Schedule Manager

Manage events and appointments with a full calendar interface:

1. Go to `http://localhost:5002` and click "📅 Schedule Manager" in the top navigation
2. **Add Events**: Click "+ Add Event" or click a date on the calendar
